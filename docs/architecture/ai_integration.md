# AI Integration

The AI layer of the Chain of Innovation employs various machine learning models to enhance research outcomes. Key components include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Frameworks for training models on research data.
- **Inference and Evaluation**: Mechanisms for deploying models and evaluating their performance.

## Example Code for Data Preprocessing (Python)

```python
1 import pandas as pd
2 from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
3 
4 # Load dataset
5 data = pd.read_csv('research_data.csv')
6;
7 # Data cleaning
8;data.dropna(inplace=True)
9;
10 # Feature selection
11 features = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
12 target = data['target']
13 
14 # Split the dataset
15 X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
