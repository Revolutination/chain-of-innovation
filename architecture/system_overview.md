# System Overview

The Chain of Innovation platform is designed to facilitate collaborative scientific research through a decentralized network. The architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Blockchain Layer**: Ensures data integrity and transparency.
2. **AI Layer**: Provides machine learning capabilities for data analysis and insights.
3. **User  Interface**: A web-based application for users to interact with the platform.

This modular architecture allows for scalability and flexibility in integrating new features.

## Example Code Snippet

```javascript
1 // Example of a basic blockchain transaction
2 const transaction = {
3     sender: "0x1234567890abcdef",
4     receiver: "0xfedcba0987654321",
5     amount: 100,
6     timestamp: Date.now()
7 };
8 
9 // Function to validate transaction
10 function validateTransaction(tx) {
11     // Basic validation logic
12     return tx.amount > 0 && tx.sender !== tx.receiver;
13 }
```
